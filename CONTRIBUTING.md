# Contributing Guidelines

This project is proprietary and not open to public contributions at this time.

If you are a collaborator under agreement, please follow these standards:
- Use feature branches
- Follow the existing code style (functional React + CSS-in-JS)
- Use meaningful commit messages (e.g. `feat: added timer controls`)
- Ensure no direct changes to `main` without PR review

All contributions require prior approval.
